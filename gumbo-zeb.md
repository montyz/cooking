### Roux
1 c. mild vegetable oil: corn, peanut, soy
1 c. unbleached all-purpose flour

### Vegetable Sauté
8 T. butter (1 stick)
2 large onions, chopped
2 green peppers, chopped
1 bunch celery with leaves, chopped

### Seasoning Puree
8 cloves garlic, peeled
¼ c. Picapeppa or Worchestershire sauce
¼ c. tomato paste
1 T. Tabasco sauce
2 t. dried basil
2 t. dried oregano
2 t. dried thyme
1 t. paprika
¼ to ½ t. cayenne
¼ to ½ t. ground allspice
¼ to ½ t. ground cloves
6-8 good grinds of fresh black peppercorns
1 can (16 oz) whole tomatoes, drained, chopped coarsely, juice and tomotoes reserved separately
1 bunch fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley, leaves and stems, rinsed and coarsely chopped

### Stock and Greens
6 c. any well-flavored chicken or vegetable stock, or bottled clam juice
2 c. tomato juice or V8 vegetable juice
1 t. salt
4 bay leaves
6 bunches greens, ideally 1 bunch each mustard greens, spinach, turnip greens, beet tops, collard greens, arugula, and watercress, very well washed and finely ribboned

1½ c. tomato or V8 Vegetable juice

1. Make the roux with the oil and flour. While the roux cooks, proceed with the other steops, but be *sure* to keep an eye on it, stirring very frequently.
2. Prepare the vegetable sauté. In a heavy cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, and sauté until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bell peppers and celery; lower the heat slightly and continue sautéing another 10 minutes. (Don't forget that roux--keep stirring it while the vegetables sauté.) Add the scallions, and sauté until limp, about 5 minutes more.
3. Meanwhile, between the sautéing and the roux-stirring, you will have time to perpare the seasoning purée. Place all the ingredients for the seasoning purée except the tomatoes and parsley in a food processor. (Pause to stir the roux and the vegetable sauté.) Buzz the purée ingredients until the garlic is chopped fine.
4. Check the roux again, then add the tomatoes and fresh parsley to the food processor. Chop coarsely.
5. Pause to take note of where you are, and to go stir the roux and vegetable sauté. When th evegetables have softened, remove from the heat and set them aside. Keep working on the roux until it has reached a nice toasty brown.
6. Now prepare the stock and greens into which the other three mixtures will eventually go. Bring to a boil the stock and tomato or V8 juice. Add the salt and bay leaves. Drop in the fresh greens. Bring back to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes.
7. Stir the roux, By now it should be properly browned, but if it isn't, continue to cook it, stirring. When the roux has browned, removed it from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Drain off any excess oil that has separated out, but be sure to leave every bit of the browned flour. Vigorously whisk in the 1 ½ cups tomato or V8 juice. It will be smooth and thick, a pale orange paste.
8. When the greens have finished their 30-minute simmer, remove them from the heat. Add to the stock pot the roux misture, the vegetable sauté, and the seasoning purée. Give a taste and adjust the seasoning, set the pot back on the stove, and let simmer over the lowest possible heat, covered, another 15 minutes. Stir often.
9. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. That's it--you've got your concentrated Gumbo Base, enough when made into soup to feed 11-15 hearty eaters. It freezes well, so for smaller batches of Gumbo Zeb, use part now, and freeze the rest in small portions.

### Soup

10. Make a soup with 6 c. gumbo zeb base, 4-6 c. stock, plus sausage, chicken, etc.
