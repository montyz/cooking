A place to keep my own recipes in markdown so I can format them and put them on my nook.

Instructions for pandoc at http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html

Markdown syntax at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

To-do:
- build.sh file
- how to do one recipe per page
- styling to remove bullets from lists
- proper symbols for 1/2, etc.
- standardization on units & measures
- proper index?
- do it in lyx instead?
